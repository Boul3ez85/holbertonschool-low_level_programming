- [The Framework](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/75)


## Resources


#### Read or watch:

- [Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)
- [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/rubber-duck-debugging-psychology/)

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
